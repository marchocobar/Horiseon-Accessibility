# Horiseon Accesibility 

## Description

This was the Module 1 Challenge for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. 
The goal of the challenge was to refactor the starter code of a website that wanted to improve their Accessibility. This included optimizing the site for SEO, making sure that the HTML had semantic elements and followed a logical structure, having all the images alt-tagged, consolidating and organzing the CSS stylesheet, and making sure the website funtioned correctly.
This helped give me a deeper understanding of CSS and HTML. 

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Installation
